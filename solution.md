## Challenges Encountered
1. I discovered that the `android` command was deprecated after installing Flutter.
2. I found the official Flutter installation instructions for Ubuntu unclear, leading me to seek guidance from YouTube [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=attW3qd2JWQ).
3. Attempting to configure Flutter through VS Code resulted in an error, prompting me to revert to terminal-based installation.
4. I encountered permission errors when setting up GitHub SSH keys, which required me to delete the existing SSH key file, restart my computer, and redo the process successfully.
5. I initially struggled with setting the PATH for Flutter because I overlooked replacing `user` in the documentation with my actual username.
